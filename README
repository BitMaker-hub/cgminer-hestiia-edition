EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ON USAGE:

Single pool:

cgminer -o stratum+tcp://pool:port -u username -p password

Multiple pools:

cgminer -o stratum+tcp://pool1:port -u pool1username -p pool1password -o stratum+tcp://pool2:port -u pool2usernmae -p pool2password

Single pool with a standard http proxy:

cgminer -o "http:proxy:port|stratum+tcp://pool:port" -u username -p password

Single pool with a socks5 proxy:

cgminer -o "socks5:proxy:port|stratum+tcp://pool:port" -u username -p password

Single pool with stratum protocol support:

cgminer -o stratum+tcp://pool:port -u username -p password

The list of proxy types are:
 http:    standard http 1.1 proxy
 http0:   http 1.0 proxy
 socks4:  socks4 proxy
 socks5:  socks5 proxy
 socks4a: socks4a proxy
 socks5h: socks5 proxy using a hostname

If you compile cgminer with a version of CURL before 7.19.4 then some of the above will
not be available. All are available since CURL version 7.19.4

If you specify the --socks-proxy option to cgminer, it will only be applied to all pools
that don't specify their own proxy setting like above


After saving configuration from the menu, you do not need to give cgminer any
arguments and it will load your configuration.

Any configuration file may also contain a single
	"include" : "filename"
to recursively include another configuration file.
Writing the configuration will save all settings from all files in the output.

SETTING UP USB DEVICES on WINDOWS/LINUX/OSX

WINDOWS:

On windows, the direct USB support requires the installation of a WinUSB
driver (NOT the ftdi_sio driver), and attaching it to the chosen USB device.

When configuring your device, plug it in and wait for windows to attempt to
install a driver on its own. It may think it has succeeded or failed but wait
for it to finish regardless.

If the driver doesn't allow mining, cgminer will get a "USB init," error message
i.e. one of:
 open device failed, err %d, you need to install a WinUSB driver for the device
or
 claim interface %d failed, err %d

This means you need to associate your device with the WinUSB driver.

The best solution for this is to use a tool called Zadig to set the driver:
 https://sourceforge.net/projects/libwdi/files/zadig/
They've moved the latest versions to:
  https://zadig.akeo.ie/

This allows you set the driver for the device to be WinUSB which is
required to make it work if you're having problems.
With Zadig, you will need to run it as administrator and if your device is
plugged in but you cannot see it, use the Menu: Options -> List All Devices
and you should be able to see the device in the drop down list as something
like: "CompacF Bitcoin Miner"
Choose the install or replace driver option and select WinUSB.

When you first switch a device over to WinUSB with Zadig and it shows that
correctly on the left of the Zadig window, but it still gives permission
errors, you may need to unplug the USB miner and then plug it back in. Some
users may need to reboot at this point.


LINUX:

The short version:

 sudo cp 01-cgminer.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/


The long version:

On linux, the direct USB support requires no drivers at all. However due to
permissions issues, you may not be able to mine directly on the devices as a
regular user without giving the user access to the device or by mining as
root (administrator). In order to give your regular user access, you can make
him a member of the plugdev group with the following commands:

 sudo usermod -G plugdev -a `whoami`

If your distribution does not have the plugdev group you can create it with:

 sudo groupadd plugdev

In order for the USB devices to instantly be owned by the plugdev group and
accessible by anyone from the plugdev group you can copy the file
"01-cgminer.rules" from the cgminer archive into the /etc/udev/rules.d
directory with the following command:

 sudo cp 01-cgminer.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/

After this you can either manually restart udev and re-login, or more easily
just reboot.


OSX:

On OSX, like Linux, no drivers need to be installed. However some devices
like the bitfury USB sticks automatically load a driver thinking they're a
modem and the driver needs to be unloaded for cgminer to work:

 sudo kextunload -b com.apple.driver.AppleUSBCDC
 sudo kextunload -b com.apple.driver.AppleUSBCDCACMData

If you are running an old Mac and desktop performance is noticeably affected,
adding the --mac-yield option may help, but also may slow down mining.

There may be a limit to the number of USB devices that you are allowed to start.
The following set of commands, followed by a reboot will increase that:

 sudo su
 touch /etc/sysctl.conf
 echo kern.sysv.semume=100 >> /etc/sysctl.conf
 chown root:wheel /etc/sysctl.conf
 chmod 0644 /etc/sysctl.conf

Some devices need superuser access to mine on them so cgminer may need to
be started with sudo
i.e.:
 sudo cgminer <insert commands here>


There is a hidden option in cgminer to dump out a lot of information
about USB that will help the developers to assist you if you are having
problems:

 --usb-dump 0

It will only help if you have a working USB mining device

---

Advanced USB options:

The --usb option can restrict how many USB devices are found:

  --usb 1:2,1:3,1:4,1:*
or
  --usb BAS:1,BFL:1,MMQ:0,ICA:0,KLN:0
or
  --usb :10

You can only use one of the above 3

The first version
  --usb 1:2,1:3,1:4,1:*
allows you to select which devices to mine on with a list of USB
 bus_number:device_address
All other USB devices will be ignored
Hotplug will also only look at the devices matching the list specified and
find nothing new if they are all in use
You can specify just the USB bus_number to find all devices like 1:*
which means any devices on USB bus_number 1
This is useful if you unplug a device then plug it back in the same port,
it usually reappears with the same bus_number but a different device_address

You can see the list of all USB devices on linux with 'sudo lsusb'
Cgminer will list the recognised USB devices

with the '-n' option or the
'--usb-dump 0' option
The '--usb-dump N' option with a value of N greater than 0 will dump a lot
of details about each recognised USB device
If you wish to see all USB devices, include the --usb-list-all option

The second version
  --usb BAS:1,BFL:1,MMQ:0,ICA:0,KLN:0
allows you to specify how many devices to choose based on each device
driver cgminer has - the current USB drivers are:
AVA, BAS, BFL, BF1, DRB, HFA, ICA, KLN and MMQ.

N.B. you can only specify which device driver to limit, not the type of
each device, e.g. with BAS:n you can limit how many BFL ASIC devices will
be checked, but you cannot limit the number of each type of BFL ASIC

Also note that the MMQ count is the number of MMQ backplanes you have
not the number of MMQ FPGAs

The third version
  --usb :10
means only use a maximum of 10 devices of any supported USB devices
Once cgminer has 10 devices it will not configure any more and hotplug will
not scan for any more
If one of the 10 devices stops working, hotplug - if enabled, as is default
- will scan normally again until it has 10 devices

  --usb :0 will disable all USB I/O other than to initialise libusb

DISPLAY:

The display is roughly split into two portions, the top status window and the
bottom scrolling log window.


STATUS WINDOW
The status window is split into overall status and per device status.

Overall status:

The output line shows the following:
 (5s):1.398T (1m):1.322T (5m):1.305T (15m):1.309T (avg):1.317Th/s

These are exponentially decaying average hashrates over 5s/1m/5m/15m and an
average since the start.

Followed by:
 A:290391  R:5101  HW:145  WU:37610.4/m

Each column is as follows:
A:  The total difficulty of Accepted shares
R:  The total difficulty of Rejected shares
HW:  The number of HardWare errors
WU:  The Work Utility defined as the number of diff1 shares work / minute
     (accepted or rejected).

alternating with:
 ST: 22  SS: 0  NB: 2  LW: 356090  GF: 0  RF: 0

ST is STaged work items (ready to use).
SS is Stale Shares discarded (detected and not submitted so don't count as rejects)
NB is New Blocks detected on the network
LW is Locally generated Work items
GF is Getwork Fail Occasions (server slow to provide work)
RF is Remote Fail occasions (server slow to accept work)

Followed by:
 Connected to stratum.kano.is diff 3.45K with stratum as user Kano

The diff shown is the current vardiff requested by the pool currently being
mined at.

Followed by:
Block: b1a8c743...  Diff:19T  Started: [00:14:27.666]  Best share: 1.18M

This shows a short stretch about the current block, when the new block started,
and the all time best difficulty share you've found since starting cgminer
this time.

Per device status:

 0: GSF 100nnnnn: 400.00MHz  85C  13% 0.79V  | 263.5G / 263.7Gh/s WU:18901.8/m

MULTIPLE POOL CONNECTIONS

FAILOVER STRATEGIES WITH MULTIPOOL:
A number of different strategies for dealing with multipool setups are
available. Each has their advantages and disadvantages so multiple strategies
are available by user choice, as per the following list:

FAILOVER:
The default strategy is failover. This means that if you input a number of
pools, it will try to use them as a priority list, moving away from the 1st
to the 2nd, 2nd to 3rd and so on. If any of the earlier pools recover, it will
move back to the higher priority ones.

ROUND ROBIN:
This strategy only moves from one pool to the next when the current one falls
idle and makes no attempt to move otherwise.

ROTATE:
This strategy moves at user-defined intervals from one active pool to the next,
skipping pools that are idle.

LOAD BALANCE:
This strategy sends work to all the pools on a quota basis. By default, all
pools are allocated equal quotas unless specified with --quota. This
apportioning of work is based on work handed out, not shares returned so is
independent of difficulty targets or rejected shares. While a pool is disabled
or dead, its quota is dropped until it is re-enabled. Quotas are forward
looking, so if the quota is changed on the fly, it only affects future work.
If all pools are set to zero quota or all pools with quota are dead, it will
fall back to a failover mode. See quota below for more information.

The failover-only flag has special meaning in combination with load-balance
mode and it will distribute quota back to priority pool 0 from any pools that
are unable to provide work for any reason so as to maintain quota ratios
between the rest of the pools.

BALANCE:
This strategy monitors the amount of difficulty 1 shares solved for each pool
and uses it to try to end up doing the same amount of work for all pools.


---

QUOTAS

The load-balance multipool strategy works off a quota based scheduler. The
quotas handed out by default are equal, but the user is allowed to specify any
arbitrary ratio of quotas. For example, if all the quota values add up to 100,
each quota value will be a percentage, but if 2 pools are specified and pool0
is given a quota of 1 and pool1 is given a quota of 9, pool0 will get 10% of
the work and pool1 will get 90%. Quotas can be changed on the fly by the API,
and do not act retrospectively. Setting a quota to zero will effectively
disable that pool unless all other pools are disabled or dead. In that
scenario, load-balance falls back to regular failover priority-based strategy.
While a pool is dead, it loses its quota and no attempt is made to catch up
when it comes back to life.

To specify quotas on the command line, pools should be specified with a
semicolon separated --quota(or -U) entry instead of --url. Pools specified with
--url are given a nominal quota value of 1 and entries can be mixed.

For example:
--url poola:porta -u usernamea -p passa --quota "2;poolb:portb" -u usernameb -p passb
Will give poola 1/3 of the work and poolb 2/3 of the work.

Writing configuration files with quotas is likewise supported. To use the above
quotas in a configuration file they would be specified thus:

"pools" : [
        {
                "url" : "poola:porta",
                "user" : "usernamea",
                "pass" : "passa"
        },
        {
                "quota" : "2;poolb:portb",
                "user" : "usernameb",
                "pass" : "passb"
        }
]

LOGGING

cgminer will log to stderr if it detects stderr is being redirected to a file.
To enable logging simply add 2>logfile.txt to your command line and logfile.txt
will contain the logged output at the log level you specify (normal, verbose,
debug etc.)

In other words if you would normally use:
./cgminer -o xxx -u yyy -p zzz
if you use
./cgminer -o xxx -u yyy -p zzz 2>logfile.txt
it will log to a file called logfile.txt and otherwise work the same.

There is also the -m option on linux which will spawn a command of your choice
and pipe the output directly to that command.

The WorkTime details 'debug' option adds details on the end of each line
displayed for Accepted or Rejected work done. An example would be:

 <-00000059.ed4834a3 M:X D:1.0 G:17:02:38:0.405 C:1.855 (2.995) W:3.440 (0.000) S:0.461 R:17:02:47

The first 2 hex codes are the previous block hash, the rest are reported in
seconds unless stated otherwise:
The previous hash is followed by the getwork mode used M:X where X is one of
P:Pool, T:Test Pool, L:LP or B:Benchmark,
then D:d.ddd is the difficulty required to get a share from the work,
then G:hh:mm:ss:n.nnn, which is when the getwork or LP was sent to the pool and
the n.nnn is how long it took to reply,
followed by 'O' on it's own if it is an original getwork, or 'C:n.nnn' if it was
a clone with n.nnn stating how long after the work was recieved that it was cloned,
(m.mmm) is how long from when the original work was received until work started,
W:n.nnn is how long the work took to process until it was ready to submit,
(m.mmm) is how long from ready to submit to actually doing the submit, this is
usually 0.000 unless there was a problem with submitting the work,
S:n.nnn is how long it took to submit the completed work and await the reply,
R:hh:mm:ss is the actual time the work submit reply was received

If you start cgminer with the --sharelog option, you can get detailed
information for each share found. The argument to the option may be "-" for
standard output (not advisable with the ncurses UI), any valid positive number
for that file descriptor, or a filename.

To log share data to a file named "share.log", you can use either:
./cgminer --sharelog 50 -o xxx -u yyy -p zzz 50>share.log
./cgminer --sharelog share.log -o xxx -u yyy -p zzz

For every share found, data will be logged in a CSV (Comma Separated Value)
format:
    timestamp,disposition,target,pool,dev,thr,sharehash,sharedata
For example (this is wrapped, but it's all on one line for real):
    1335313090,reject,
    ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff00000000,
    http://localhost:8337,ASC0,0,
    6f983c918f3299b58febf95ec4d0c7094ed634bc13754553ec34fc3800000000,
    00000001a0980aff4ce4a96d53f4b89a2d5f0e765c978640fe24372a000001c5
    000000004a4366808f81d44f26df3d69d7dc4b3473385930462d9ab707b50498
    f681634a4f1f63d01a0cd43fb338000000000080000000000000000000000000
    0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000080020000

BENCHMARK

The --benchmark option hashes a single fixed work item over and over and does
not submit shares to any pools.

The --benchfile <arg> option hashes the work given in the file <arg> supplied.
The format of the work file is:
version,merkleroot,prevhash,diffbits,noncetime
Any empty line or any line starting with '#' or '/' is ignored.
When it reaches the end of the file it continues back at the top.

The format of the data items matches the byte ordering and format of the
the bitcoind getblock RPC output.

An example file containing bitcoin block #1 would be:

# Block 1
1,0e3e2357e806b6cdb1f70b54c3a3a17b6714ee1f0e68bebb44a74b1efd512098,00000000001
9d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f,1d00ffff,1231469665

However, the work data should be one line without the linebreak in the middle

If you use --benchfile <arg>, then --benchfile-display will output a log line,
for each nonce found, showing the nonce value in decimal and hex and the work
used to find it in hex.

FAQ

Q: Help, I've started cgminer and everything reads zero!?
A: Welcome to bitcoin mining. Your computer by itself cannot mine bitcoin no
matter how powerful it is. You have to purchase dedicated mining hardware
called ASICs to plug into your computer. See Q regarding ASICs below.

Q: I have multiple USB stick devices but I can't get them all to work at once?
A: Very few USB hubs deliver the promised power required to run as many devices
as they fit if all of them draw power from USB.

Q: I've plugged my devices into my USB hub but nothing shows up?
A: RPis and Windows have incomplete or non-standard USB3 support so they may
never work. It may be possible to get a USB3 hub to work by plugging it into
a USB2 hub. When choosing a hub, USB2 hubs are preferable whenever possible
due to better support all round.

Q: Can I mine on servers from different networks (eg xxxcoin and bitcoin) at
the same time?
A: No, cgminer keeps a database of the block it's working on to ensure it does
not work on stale blocks, and having different blocks from two networks would
make it invalidate the work from each other.

Q: Can I configure cgminer to mine with different login credentials or pools
for each separate device?
A: No.

Q: Can I put multiple pools in the config file?
A: Yes, check the example.conf file. Alternatively, set up everything either on
the command line or via the menu after startup and choose settings->write
config file and the file will be loaded one each startup.

Q: The build fails with gcc is unable to build a binary.
A: Remove the "-march=native" component of your CFLAGS as your version of gcc
does not support it. Also -O2 is capital o 2, not zero 2.

Q: Work keeps going to my backup pool even though my primary pool hasn't
failed?
A: Cgminer checks for conditions where the primary pool is lagging and will
pass some work to the backup servers under those conditions. The reason for
doing this is to try its absolute best to keep the devices working on something
useful and not risk idle periods. You can disable this behaviour with the
option --failover-only.

Q: Is this a virus?
A: Cgminer is being packaged with other trojan scripts and some antivirus
software is falsely accusing cgminer.exe as being the actual virus, rather
than whatever it is being packaged with. If you installed cgminer yourself,
then you do not have a virus on your computer. Complain to your antivirus
software company. They seem to be flagging even source code now from cgminer
as viruses, even though text source files can't do anything by themself.

Q: Can you modify the display to include more of one thing in the output and
less of another, or can you change the quiet mode or can you add yet another
output mode?
A: Everyone will always have their own view of what's important to monitor.
The defaults are very sane and I have very little interest in changing this
any further. There is far more detail in the API output than can be reasonably
displayed on the small console window, and using an external interface such
as miner.php is much more useful for setups with many devices.

Q: What are the best parameters to pass for X pool/hardware/device.
A: Virtually always, the DEFAULT parameters give the best results. Most user
defined settings lead to worse performance.

Q: What happened to CPU and GPU mining?
A: Their efficiency makes them irrelevant in the bitcoin mining world today
and the author has no interest in supporting alternative coins that are better
mined by these devices.

Q: GUI version?
A: No. The RPC interface makes it possible for someone else to write one
though, and miner.php can create web page access to the RPC API

Q: I'm having an issue. What debugging information should I provide?
A: Start cgminer with your regular commands and add -D -T --verbose and provide
the full startup output and a summary of your hardware and operating system.

Q: Why don't you provide win64 builds?
A: Win32 builds work everywhere.

Q: Is it faster to mine on windows or linux?
A: It makes no difference in terms of performance. It comes down to choice of
operating system for their various features and your comfort level. However
linux is the primary development platform and is virtually guaranteed to be
more stable.

Q: My network gets slower and slower and then dies for a minute?
A; Try the --net-delay option if you are on a GBT server. This does nothing
with stratum mining.

Q: I run PHP on windows to access the API with the example miner.php. Why does
it fail when php is installed properly but I only get errors about Sockets not
working in the logs?
A: http://us.php.net/manual/en/sockets.installation.php

Q: What is an ASIC?
A: They are Application Specify Integrated Circuit devices and provide the
highest performance per unit power due to being dedicated to only one purpose.
They are the only meaningful way to mine bitcoin today.

Q: What is stratum and how do I use it?
A: Stratum is a protocol designed for pooled mining in such a way as to
minimise the amount of network communications, yet scale to hardware of any
speed. With versions of cgminer 2.8.0+, if a pool has stratum support, cgminer
will automatically detect it and switch to the support as advertised if it can.
The advantages of stratum to the miner are no
delays in getting more work for the miner, less rejects across block changes,
and far less network communications for the same amount of mining hashrate. If
you do NOT wish cgminer to automatically switch to stratum protocol even if it
is detected, add the --fix-protocol option.

Q: Why don't the statistics add up: Accepted, Rejected, Stale, Hardware Errors,
Diff1 Work, etc. when mining greater than 1 difficulty shares?
A: As an example, if you look at 'Difficulty Accepted' in the RPC API, the number
of difficulty shares accepted does not usually exactly equal the amount of work
done to find them. If you are mining at 8 difficulty, then you would expect on
average to find one 8 difficulty share, per 8 single difficulty shares found.
However, the number is actually random and converges over time, it is an average,
not an exact value, thus you may find more or less than the expected average.

Q: My keyboard input momentarily pauses or repeats keys every so often on
windows while mining?
A: The USB implementation on windows can be very flaky on some hardware and
every time cgminer looks for new hardware to hotplug it it can cause these
sorts of problems. You can disable hotplug with:
--hotplug 0

Q: What is a PGA?
A: Cgminer supports 3 FPGAs: BitForce, Icarus and ModMiner.
They are Field-Programmable Gate Arrays that have been programmed to do Bitcoin
mining. Since the acronym needs to be only 3 characters, the "Field-" part has
been skipped.

Q: What should my Work Utility (WU) be?
A: Work utility is the product of hashrate * luck and only stabilises over a
very long period of time. Assuming all your work is valid work, bitcoin mining
should produce a work utility of approximately 1 per 71.6MH. This means at
5GH you should have a WU of 5000 / 71.6 or ~ 69. You cannot make your machine
do "better WU" than this - it is luck related. However you can make it much
worse if your machine produces a lot of hardware errors producing invalid work.

Q: What should I build in for a generic distribution binary?
A: There are a number of drivers that expect to be used on dedicated standalone
hardware. That said, the drivers that are designed to work generically with
USB on any hardware are the following:

--enable-avalon
--enable-avalon2
--enable-avalon4
--enable-avalon7
--enable-avalon8
--enable-bflsc
--enable-bitfury
--enable-cointerra
--enable-drillbit
--enable-gekko
--enable-hashfast
--enable-hashratio
--enable-icarus
--enable-klondike

Q: How do I use the --decode function to decode a pool's coinbase?
A: You need to have a bitcoind with server functionality and pass it the
credentials as the first pool in your config, and pass the pool's address that
you wish to decode as the second pool configured. Note the bitcoind NEEDS the
http:// prefix.

e.g.:
./cgminer -o http://localhost:8332 -u user -p pass -o stratum.kano.is:3333 -u cgminer --decode
